A smart Python tool that automatically detects a document within an image, corrects its perspective, and produces a clean, top-down "scanned" view. This project was developed as a capstone for my internship, showcasing skills in computer vision and image processing.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automatic Edge Detection:** Intelligently finds the four corners of a document using OpenCV's Canny edge detection and contour analysis.
* **Perspective Correction:** Applies a perspective transform to "un-skew" the document, creating a perfectly rectangular, top-down image.
* **Image Enhancement:** Improves the final output with adaptive thresholding to create a high-contrast, black-and-white scan.
* **Simple & Efficient:** Built with a streamlined pipeline using industry-standard libraries.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KBarathraj/AI-Document-Scanner.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd AI-Document-Scanner
    ```

3.  **Run the script in your environment (e.g., Google Colab):**
    Open the `.ipynb` file and upload an image of a document to be scanned. The notebook will process the image and display the final scanned output.
